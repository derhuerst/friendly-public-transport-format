# Friendly Public Transport Format (FPTF)

This repo outlines **a format for APIs, libraries and datasets containing and working with public transport data.** See **[the spec](spec/readme.md)** and theÂ [list of JS modules](modules.md).

It tries to keep things simple:

- JSON and [ndjson](http://ndjson.org) only
- a flat, intuitive representation of public transport timetables & infrastructure
- conceptually inspired by the de-facto standard [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/)

Specifically, it trades

- efficiency for consumability: GTFS sets feel like database dumps.
- completeness for ease-of-use: Only basic attributes are required, most is optional.

Things still missing:

- concise definitions
- clear naming & recommendations for optional data
